# Isabelle Proofs in Computer Science and Mathematics

Welcome to the Isabelle Proofs Repository, a collection of mathematical proofs crafted using the powerful Isabelle/HOL tool. Isabelle/HOL, with its intuitive Isar proof language, simplifies the process of creating precise and clear mathematical proofs within the Higher Order Logic framework. This tool allows for the elegant expression of complex theorems and lemmas, fostering a deeper understanding of mathematical truths.

I envision a future where automated theorem provers play a pivotal role in helping prove previously unproven theorems, leading to the expansion of our collective knowledge. Join me on this exciting journey!

## Getting Started

Before you can start working with the proofs in this repository, you need to install Isabelle. You can download it from the [official website](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).

## Proofs in this Repository

This repository contains a diverse array of proofs, each covering a wide range of topics. Each proof is self-contained in its own file and includes comments to explain the proof process. This structure allows for easy understanding and navigation.

Here you can find proofs in:

- [Data Structures](/DataStructures/): Fairly straightforward set of theorems and definitions that prove theorems related to Data Structures like Lists and Trees, and subsets of them like Binary Search Trees.

- [Real Analysis](/RealAnalysis/): Set of theorems proved based on learnings from Terence Tao's [Analysis I](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-10-1789-6) book.
